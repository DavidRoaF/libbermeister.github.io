        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Brandon. I live in Minnesota. Some hobbies of mine are playing board games, video games, biking, and skiing. Currently, I work as a software tester at a financial services company. I perform testing and write automated tests using C# and the Selenium UI testing framework.
        </p>
        
        <h3>My Software Development Goal</h3>
        <p>I'd like to make the switch to a developer role in the near future. I'd like to learn a variety of technologies so that I can work on both the frontend and backend for web applications. Using these skills, I'd also like to create general web sites and blogs. I'm interested in learning popular frontend frameworks and libraries such as React, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. In addition to technical skills, I'm looking to meet other developers or mentors to learn from and work on projects with.
        </p>
